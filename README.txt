PRIMATE README

Primate is a plug-in for the 3D software Rhino with Grasshopper, 
the scripting interface for parametric definitions of openNURBS geometry.  
Primate uses a C# package on the .NET platform to create communication 
between the Leap Motion Controller device and the full suite of 3D modelling in Rhino and Grasshopper.  This brings the intuition of hand gestures to a rigorous platform for programming, modelling and parameter control. 
Grasshopper is an algorthmic editor that runs in McNeel's Rhino.

Move the ExampleFile folder to a folder outside of the Primate_LM folder.  
Open the Example File Primate-Grid-Demo in Rhino and Grid-Demo-Primate in Grasshopper.  

The remaining Primate_LM folder contents should be added to Rhino loading by typing GrasshopperDeveloperSettings
in Rhino and adding a reference to the Primate_LM folder.  

Primate is developed by McEwen Studio | Brooklyn, NY
